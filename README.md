# HON350
This project was completed as a requirement of the Mount Union honors program. The project was to be completed in collaboration 
with a prerequisite honors diversity course and a current class related to my major.

Original abstract for the project:

      My project will examine data taken from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). 
      NCES provides data from 6858 schools across the US on the number of students enrolled in 
      certain college majors over the years ranging from 1980 to 2018 and the racial background of  
      these students. I will develop code to process this large amount of data to analyze statistics 
      such as how studentâ€™s chosen majors have changed over the past decade and how this is related 
      to factors such as their racial background and choice of school. This project will allow me to 
      efficiently use python to process large amounts of data and apply some of the programming 
      techniques learned in class. Upon processing the data, I would expect to see that majors in 
      the STEM field and health profession show a steady increase over time as technology and the 
      need for scientists becomes a priority for society. Additionally, as minorities are given 
      more opportunities to succeed in society, I also expect diversity in college statistics to 
      increase as well over the years. I will interpret the results of the processed data and 
      organize it into a poster while also describing the process taken to gather the results 
      and the problems encountered and troubleshooted in the process. 

The data was taken from the National Center for Education Statistics:

      attendance status, and level of student: Fall 2018 (n.d.).
